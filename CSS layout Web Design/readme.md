Must haves
Create your new repository, and add 3 HTML files called: flexbox.html, grid.html.
Make sure each of the two files uses the following HTML structure:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>CSS Layout - Holy Grail</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <!-- Place a title here -->
    </header>

    <nav>
      <!-- Place a list of links here -->
    </nav>

    <main>
      <!-- Place a long text here -->
    </main>

    <aside>
      <!-- Place a small image here -->
    </aside>

    <footer>
      <!-- Place a copyright notice here -->
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
Create 2 CSS files called, you guessed it: flexbox.css, grid.css.
Make sure each HTML file includes the corresponding CSS file.
In each of the CSS files you will use one of the two different techniques. You will have to do some googling to figure out how to use flexbox and grid to create the Holy Grail layout.
Create a final file called index.html: this file will only contain the links to the other two files.
Make your work available online via Netlify.
Visit your pages online, change the size and look how smoothly everything adjusts. Now repeat a thousand times and feel good about yourself.
